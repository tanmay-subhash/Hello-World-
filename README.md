# Hello-World-
A sample repository to see how GitHub works.

Hey there,homo sapiens !

I'm new to Github and would be taking up plenty of projects to upload them later here.
There's nohing special about that.You all have been doing this for years as long as you all have been here.
There are a few ideas that my mind is brimming up with and I'm hoping to engage in this pointless exercise that I've been caught up in for a while now.
